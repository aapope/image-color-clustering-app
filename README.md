# Image Color Clusters

A simple Streamlit app to cluster colors in an image using k-means clustering. This flattens the number of colors in the image into the `k` mean colors. `k` is configurable, but must be set beforehand.

Mostly I built this as a way to explore Streamlit.


## Usage

Download the repo, install the requirements, and run the app using `streamlit run cluster_colors.py`
